# Luleå Java courses with Scala
This is where I do the same exercises and labs as in the repository [Java courses](https://github.com/pergran1/LuleaJavaCourses) from Luleå University but this time I use Scala instead. 

Using Scala and Java to solve the same problems is for me a great way to learn more about each language and different solutions that can be used. I must say that Scala really grow on me while solving these problems.
