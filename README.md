# LuleaJavaCourseswithScala
This is where I do the same exercises as in the [Java courses](https://github.com/pergran1/LuleaJavaCourses) from Lule√• University but this time I use Scala instead. 

Using Scala and Java to solve the same problems is for me a great way to learn more about each language and how to approach a way that works great.
